My goal during this project is to exercise all the skills that I have learned thus far.

In this project I am going to use my learned skills in git, command line and vs Code.
Demonstrating my use of creating boilerplates, lists, links, adding images and etc. in the VS code.
Committing and pushing my saved versions of it on the GitHub.

Hopefully by the end of this project I will have gained confidence in my abilities.
